Familiar functions
Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: print() and type(). There are also functions like str(), int(), bool() and float() to switch between data types. You can find out about them here. These are built-in functions as well.

Calling a function is easy. To get the type of 3.0 and store the output as a new variable, result, you can use the following:

result = type(3.0)

Use print() in combination with type() to print out the type of var1.
Use len() to get the length of the list var1. Wrap it in a print() call to directly print it out.
Use int() to convert var2 to an integer. Store the output as out2.
###ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER###
# Create variables var1 and var2
var1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
var2 = True

# Print out type of var1
print(var1)

# Print out length of var1
len(var1)
print(type(var1))
# Convert var2 to an integer: out2
out2 = int(var2)

Help!
Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: help(). In IPython specifically, you can also use ? before the function name.

To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:

help(max)
?max
Use the IPython Shell to open up the documentation on pow(). Do this by typing ?pow or help(pow) and hitting Enter.

Which of the following statements is true?

###ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER###
pow() takes three arguments: base, exp, and mod. Without mod, the function will return an error.

pow() takes three required arguments: base, exp, and None.

pow() requires base and exp arguments; mod is optional. #THISONE

pow() takes two arguments: exp and mod. Missing exp results in an error.

Multiple arguments
In the previous exercise, you identified optional arguments by viewing the documentation with help(). You'll now apply this to change the behavior of the sorted() function.

Have a look at the documentation of sorted() by typing help(sorted) in the IPython Shell.

You'll see that sorted() takes three arguments: iterable, key, and reverse. In this exercise, you'll only have to specify iterable and reverse, not key.

Two lists have been created for you.

Can you paste them together and sort them in descending order?

Use + to merge the contents of first and second into a new list: full.
Call sorted() and on full and specify the reverse argument to be True. Save the sorted list as full_sorted.
Finish off by printing out full_sorted.
###ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER######ANSWER###
# Create lists first and second
first = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0]
second = [10.75, 9.50]

# Paste together first and second: full
full = first + second

# Sort full in descending order: full_sorted
full_sorted = sorted(full, reverse=True)

# Print out full_sorted
print(full_sorted)
